**Description :spiral_notepad:  :** 

:wave:  Hello ! Today I'm releasing `mth-dev-commands`, a standalone resource that compiles some useful commands for developers !

**Usage :hammer_and_wrench: :**

To use the resource, download it, put the `mth-dev-commands` folder in your main resources folder.
Add `start mth-dev-commands` to your server.cfg and you're good to go !

**Features :sparkles: :**
* STANDALONE : this means that you don't need any dependencies to start this script on your server
* Easy to use
* FREE
* Open Source

**Commands :keyboard: :**
* /devcoords : Toggles the display of your coordinates and more
* /devprops : Toggles the display of informations about the props around you
* /devbones : Toggles the display of the bones names of your ped
* /devtraffic : Toggles the display of the closest traffic nodes (Thanks to louyike for the inspiration / part of the snippet !)
